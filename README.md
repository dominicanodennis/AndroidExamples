Android example collection... maybe there will be more

This is an example how to pass values from an activity with a ListView to another activity. 
Between both activities is a DialogFragment that asks if you want to open the next activity.
In the next activity the list items value is displayed.

Problem left: prevent DialogFragment to be passed to the BackStack which causes if the user presses
              "back" the dialog to be displayed again.

Note: Don't mind the german comments.
